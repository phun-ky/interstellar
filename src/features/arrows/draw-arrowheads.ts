/**
 * Draws directional arrows towards the nearest celestial bodies that are off-screen.
 *
 * The candidates are the bodies drawn in the current frame (`globalThis.NEAREST_BODIES`),
 * so hidden bodies (e.g. moons when zoomed out, or comets when toggled off) are left out.
 * Off-screen bodies are sorted by their distance from the **center of the viewport**,
 * and the nearest `count` of them get an arrow at the viewport edge pointing towards them.
 *
 * Bodies in (almost) the same direction, like the stars of a multiple star system,
 * share one arrow, labelled with the nearest body's name and how many more it covers
 * (e.g. `Alpha Centauri A +2`). Labels that would overlap are moved apart.
 *
 * Which label moves aside is remembered from frame to frame: labels that were
 * not moved in the last frame are placed first, nearest body first, and moved
 * labels after them. Without that, two labels whose bodies are about as far
 * away take turns being moved as the nearer one changes, and jump back and
 * forth. A moved label stays on its line while that is free, and goes back as
 * soon as its own place is. For the same reason, a merged arrow keeps the body
 * it was named after in the last frame while that body is still in it.
 *
 * @param {DrawDirectionalArrowsPropsType} props - The properties required for drawing arrows.
 * @returns {void}

 * ```ts
 * const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas') as HTMLCanvasElement;
 * const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
 * if (ctx) {
 *   drawDirectionalArrows({
 *     space: ctx,
 *     canvasWidth: canvas.width,
 *     canvasHeight: canvas.height,
 *     count: 10
 *   });
