## Functions

### drawArrow()

```ts
function drawArrow(space, angle, canvasWidth, canvasHeight, name): void;
```

Defined in:
[features/arrows/utils/draw-arrow.ts:27](https://github.com/phun-ky/interstellar/blob/main/src/features/arrows/utils/draw-arrow.ts#L27)

Draws an arrow pointing in a specified direction at the edge of the viewport,
along with a label placed near the arrow.

The arrow is positioned based on an angle, calculated from the center of the
canvas. The label is adjusted to ensure it remains within the viewport.
