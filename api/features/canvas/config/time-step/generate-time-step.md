## Functions

### generateTimeStep()

```ts
function generateTimeStep(): void;
```

Defined in:
[features/canvas/config/time-step/generate-time-step.ts:34](https://github.com/phun-ky/interstellar/blob/main/src/features/canvas/config/time-step/generate-time-step.ts#L34)

Generates a time step value based on the selected speed mode while accounting
for different monitor refresh rates.

This function updates `timeStep.value` and `timeStep.unit` to adjust the
simulation speed. The speed mode is determined by the `SPEED_MODE` value. If no
mode is explicitly set, the function calculates the time step based on real-time
elapsed milliseconds (`deltaTime`), normalized to account for variations in
frame rates (e.g., 60Hz vs. 144Hz) to ensure consistent simulation speed across
different monitors.

The function supports the following modes:

- `'framePerDay'`: Each frame corresponds to 1 day.
- `'spedUp'`: Each frame corresponds to 10 days.
- `'insane'`: Each frame corresponds to 1000 days.
- Default: Uses real-time elapsed time for smooth scaling, normalized for FPS
  variations.

**Frame Rate Normalization:** The default mode scales `deltaTime` using an
expected frame duration (assumed 60 FPS) to prevent higher refresh rate monitors
(e.g., 144Hz) from running the simulation too fast.

#### Returns

`void`

#### Example

```ts
generateTimeStep();
console.log(timeStep.value, timeStep.unit);
```
