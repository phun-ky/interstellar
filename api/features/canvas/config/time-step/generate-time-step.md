## Functions

### generateTimeStep()

```ts
function generateTimeStep(): void;
```

Defined in: features/canvas/config/time-step/generate-time-step.ts:29

Generates a time step value based on the selected speed mode.

This function updates `timeStep.value` and `timeStep.unit` to adjust the
simulation speed. The speed mode is determined by the `speedMode` dropdown. If
no mode is explicitly set, the function calculates the time step based on
real-time elapsed milliseconds (`deltaTime`) divided by one day in milliseconds.

The function supports the following modes:

- `'framePerDay'`: Each frame corresponds to 1 day.
- `'spedUp'`: Each frame corresponds to 10 days.
- `'insane'`: Each frame corresponds to 1000 days.
- Default: Uses real-time elapsed time for smooth scaling.

#### Returns

`void`

#### Example

```ts
generateTimeStep();
console.log(timeStep.value, timeStep.unit);
```
