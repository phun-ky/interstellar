## Functions

### waitFor()

```ts
function waitFor(ms): Promise<void>;
```

Defined in: utils/wait-for.ts:22

Delays execution for the specified time using `setTimeout`.

## **Functionality:**

- Returns a **Promise** that resolves **after** the specified time (in
  milliseconds).
- Useful for **delaying execution**, creating **timeouts**, or **simulating wait
  periods**.

## **Usage in Async Operations:**

- Used in **animations**, **API polling**, or **delayed UI updates**.
- Prevents blocking the main thread by utilizing asynchronous execution.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type     | Description                       |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| `ms`      | `number` | The time to wait in milliseconds. |

#### Returns

[`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<`void`>

A Promise that resolves after the specified time.

#### Example

```ts
// Wait for 2 seconds before executing the next line
await waitFor(2000);
console.log('2 seconds later...');
```
