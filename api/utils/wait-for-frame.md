## Functions

### waitForFrame()

```ts
function waitForFrame(): Promise<number>;
```

Defined in:
[utils/wait-for-frame.ts:26](https://github.com/phun-ky/interstellar/blob/main/src/utils/wait-for-frame.ts#L26)

Waits for the next animation frame using `requestAnimationFrame`.

## **Functionality:**

- Returns a **Promise** that resolves with the **timestamp** of the next
  animation frame.
- Allows synchronization of animations and UI updates with the browser's
  **rendering cycle**.

## **Usage in Animations & Rendering:**

- Ensures DOM updates occur before measuring elements (`getBoundingClientRect`).
- Helps synchronize animations with smooth transitions.

#### Returns

[`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\<`number`>

- A Promise that resolves with the timestamp of the next animation frame.

#### Example

```ts
// Wait for the next animation frame before measuring an element
await waitForFrame();
const rect = el.getBoundingClientRect();

// Get the timestamp of the next frame
const timestamp = await waitForFrame();
console.log(timestamp);
```
